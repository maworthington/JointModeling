# JointModeling

This repository contains code to replicate our current study using a joint modeling framework to predict conversion to psychosis and symptom remission in the clinical high-risk for psychosis population. We were interested in understanding how early symptom change differs between outcome groups (e.g., converters vs. non-converters, remitters vs. non-remitters) and how this information might improve prediction of later outcomes. 

Data from the third wave of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS3) was used (n = 488). We found that joint models (JM) performed significantly higher than baseline models in predicting both conversion to psychosis (JM balanced accuracy = 0.91, baseline model balanced accuracy = 0.65) and symptom remission (JM balanced accuracy = 0.90, baseline model balanced accuracy = 0.60). We also saw different clinical profiles emerge for each outcome by incorporating short-term longitudinal change in our feature selection process. Ultimately, joint models led to much better discrimination of outcomes than baseline models (see figure below). 

This study is currently under review for publication.
